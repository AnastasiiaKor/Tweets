# Tweets.App

This application is somewhat similar to Twitter, but very far from it. The app
uses routing, when you land on the tweets page you get a list of users from the
backend, there is an option to follow and unfollow them, pagination and lazy
loading of users on a button click are also implemented. The app also features
filtering by status or all users. React, React Hooks, React Routing, axios,
emotion/styled, and react select are the tools and libraries used in this app.
The build was made on an educational template.
